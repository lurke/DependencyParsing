Phase 2
Dependency Parsing
Nathaniel Herman

So far this implementation is mostly working. You can run the parser with
a training model which uses the actual dependency tree to predict the
shift, left, and rights with full accuracy. Then you can create an SVM
based on this training data and run other data through the parser with a 
predictor model which uses the SVM to predict the shifts, lefts, and rights.

Currently this all works completely for most of the files in at least wsj/00
in the penn treebank dataset. The way I test it currently is to just run
the predictor on the same data set as the training, which should theoretically
give the same results, at least most of the time. This is indeed true, though
when run on the entire 00 dataset, we do get some mismatches (usually things
like parent relations being slightly off in the predicted sentence). This may
just be because with a large enough dataset, we actually do predict different
things when run on the same dataset.

There is also something a little weird where the training model sometimes
doesn't manage to completely parse the sentence, and instead ends up
with several uncombined subtrees (this happens when the algorithm chooses to 
shift every element in our list for a certain iteration, rather than doing a 
right or left on any of them). This happens fairly seldomly, and probably
means I'm combining the trees in such a way that we become unable to construct
the original. I'm not too sure how to handle this--currently I combine 2 trees
if there is a child-parent relation between them AND the child has no children
of its own that still need to be added to it. This might not be enough, though?

What's missing:
The above issues should be fixed. Then we need to run on the full dataset!
This will take a long time, and may require us to implement section 4.2 of the
paper, where they create different SVMs for each POS tag to make the
calculation of the SVM tractable.
Then we need to implement code that checks the accuracy of our predictor model,
so we can see if we're getting the same accuracy as the paper.
